# ArableLandscape-PestControl

![Model description](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20394839-a73e-4bcc-9e45-5a9dc866cf2f)

## Overview
This repository will contain the code for modeling the dynamics of pest-regulating hoverflies (*Diptera: Syrphinae*) and their aphid prey across various agricultural and non-crop habitats. The model simulates how different landscape compositions, including early-season crops, late-season crops, flower-rich field margins, and woody areas, affect the survival and effectiveness of hoverflies as natural pest control agents.
For an in-depth model description, please check out our publication: 

Mansier, L & van Rijn, P.C.J. (In press). Agricultural landscape management for natural pest control. *Journal of Applied Ecology*

## Key Features
- **Landscape-Based Modeling:** Simulates hoverfly resource utilization across different habitats in agricultural landscapes.
- **Dynamic Pest Control:** Predicts the effectiveness of natural pest control based on the availability of prey and floral resources throughout the year.
- **Multi-Habitat Integration:** Includes multiple habitat types that provide essential resources at different times of the year.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- R
- Package "deSolve"

### Running the model
The model can be found in the *Main_model_components* folder. Before running this script, you will need to install the package DeSolve if this package is not installed yet `install.packages("deSolve")`. After installation of this package you can run the model. The default run time is 20 years, which will take approximately 4 minutes, but can easily be made shorter by editing line 372. At the end of the script a data frame is created. You can save this dataframe to your computer by first setting a working directory `setw("")` and then by saving the data frame to that working directory `saveRDS(data_frame_PopDyn, file="ArableLandscape-PestControl.RData")`. You can visualise the data using our data visualisation scripts that are in the same folder, these scripts generate the graphs used in our paper.
