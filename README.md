# AgroLandscape-PestControl

## Overview
This repository contains the code for modeling the dynamics of pest-regulating hoverflies (*Diptera: Syrphinae*) and their aphid prey across various agricultural and non-crop habitats. The model simulates how different landscape compositions, including early-season crops, late-season crops, flower-rich field margins, and woody areas, affect the survival and effectiveness of hoverflies as natural pest control agents.
For an in-depth model description, please check out our publication: 

Mansier, L & van Rijn, P.C.J. (In press). Agricultural landscape management for natural pest control. *Journal of Applied Ecology*

## Key Features
- **Landscape-Based Modeling:** Simulates hoverfly resource utilization across different habitats in agricultural landscapes.
- **Dynamic Pest Control:** Predicts the effectiveness of natural pest control based on the availability of prey and floral resources throughout the year.
- **Multi-Habitat Integration:** Includes multiple habitat types that provide essential resources at different times of the year.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- R
- Package "DeSolve"

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    edit
    ```
2. Install and load the required R package
   ```bash
    edit
    ```
### Running the Model
1. blabla runs the model with default parameter values; This will simulate the dynamics of hoverflies and their aphid prey based on the landscape composition defined in the main paper.
2. see blabla file for the script with which we analysed the script
